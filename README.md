# Scripts

R scripts are located at `./Scripts` consisting of:

1. LUAD_public.R: Public LUAD bulk and single cell transcriptomics analysis

2. LUAD_pt_bulk.R: Bulk sequencing analysis for LUAD patient biopsy

3. LUAD_pt_smi.R: Nanostring CosMx SMI spatial transcriptomics anlaysis for LUAD patient biopsy

# Data

Raw sequences for tumor biopsy bulk RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics and patient-derived tumoroid bulk RNAseq are found in GEO Accession number (pending).
